                When Virelia fell, Queen Elira lost everything—her crown, her kingdom, and her king, who died days after the war ended.
                
                She wandered the ruins in silence until she found Sir Caelis, the last surviving knight. He did not offer comfort—only a lesson.
                
                “Move like them,” he said. “But strike like something they never saw coming.”
                
                He taught her the knight’s leap—the art of bending paths, of jumping over obstacles, of breaking patterns.
                
                And when she returned, she was not just a queen.
                
                She was vengeance with a new shape.
                
                She was the Avenger.
                With the help of the night she taught her remaining warriors the art of jumping over pieces.
